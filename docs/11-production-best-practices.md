# **Production & Security Best Practices**

Deploying **VibeBlocks** in a production environment requires moving beyond basic functional logic toward a focus on observability, security, and long-term maintainability. This guide outlines the engineering standards recommended by **AA Digital Business** for enterprise-grade deployments.

## **1\. Security & Data Sanitization**

Since the ExecutionContext is designed to be fully serializable, it often crosses trust boundaries (e.g., being stored in a database or sent to a frontend).

* **Sanitize Exceptions:** By default, VibeBlocks logs full exception strings. In production, pass a custom `exception_sanitizer` callable when creating the `ExecutionContext` to strip sensitive information (such as DB connection strings or internal paths) before it is written to the trace.

\# Provide a sanitizer that removes internal details  
def sanitize(e: Exception) \-\> str:  
    return f"\[{type(e).\_\_name\_\_}\] An internal error occurred."

ctx \= ExecutionContext(data\=my\_data, exception\_sanitizer\=sanitize)

\# Or use execute\_flow and pass a pre-built context  
runner \= SyncRunner()  
outcome \= runner.run(flow, ctx)  
* **Avoid Storing Secrets in Context:** Never store API keys, passwords, or raw PII (Personally Identifiable Information) inside the ctx.data object. Use references (IDs) and fetch secrets within the Block's execution logic using a secure vault.  
* **JSON Deserialization Safety:** When using ExecutionContext.from\_json(), always provide a data\_cls to ensure the incoming data is validated against a strict schema (Dataclass or Pydantic) to prevent injection attacks via arbitrary dictionary keys.

## **2\. Observability & Monitoring**

VibeBlocks provides a built-in trace, but in production, this should integrate with your broader monitoring stack.

* **External Tracing:** Use the log\_event hook to pipe VibeBlocks events into OpenTelemetry, Datadog, or ELK.  
* **Execution IDs:** Always populate ctx.metadata\['request\_id'\] or ctx.metadata\['correlation\_id'\] at the start of a flow. This allows you to reconstruct the entire history of a specific user interaction across your logs.

## **3\. Performance & Context Management**

The "Zero-Gravity" nature of VibeBlocks makes it fast, but improper context management can lead to bottlenecks.

* **Context Size:** Avoid putting large binary blobs (images, large PDFs) directly into ctx.data. Store these in object storage (S3/GCS) and keep only the **URI** and **metadata** in the context. Large contexts increase serialization overhead and latency.  
* **Thread Safety:** The SyncRunner uses a thread pool for timeouts. Ensure that your blocks are thread-safe if you are running multiple flows concurrently in a single process.

## **4\. Reliability in Compensation**

The COMPENSATE strategy is only as good as your undo logic.

* **Idempotency is Mandatory:** Compensation handlers may be triggered multiple times in edge cases (e.g., a network failure during the undo process). Every undo function must be safe to run more than once.  
* **Check Completed blocks:** Always rely on ctx.completed\_blocks to decide if an undo operation is necessary. VibeBlocks handles this internally, but your custom orchestration logic should respect this set.
